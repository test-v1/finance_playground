The notebooks here shows rolling returns for NSE index data.

Some notes -

- Fresh index data can be downloaded from https://www.niftyindices.com/reports/historical-data
- Some index data (e.g. AlphaLowVol & Momentun) now only return values from 2019 or 2020 onwards. For those cases, our earlier downloaded data (in `raw_data/`) needs to be appended manually to make the whole set.
